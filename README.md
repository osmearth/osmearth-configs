# OSM Earth iD Editor Custom Configs

Includes examples and configurations files for specfic projects on https://osm.earth

The OSM Earth fork of iD editor allows custom preset and imagery options to be passed to iD from the tasking manager.

Use cases:

* When you need more than one custom imagery option, for example multiple Landsat and Sentinel images, false color, composites from different time period etc.
* When you want custom overlay layers (imagery layers with PNG transparency suitable to be overlays on top of the base map)
* When you want to simplify the list of preset options available
* When you want to add a custom preset option, bespoke combination of tags not normally offered in iD Editor
